This example was taken from Jackman's "Bayesian Analysis for the Social Sciences", section 6.3. 

> In Nov. 1993, Pennsylvania held legislative election. In the 2nd district, the Democratic candidate lost to the Republican candidate by a count of the machine-cast votes, 19,127 to 19,691. Among hand-counted absentee ballots, the Democrat won 1,396 to 371. The Republican sued, saying the absentee count was fraudulent. See the plot below to see the anomalous district (in red).

The anomalous district is in the data set as `y[22]`. The full data can be found in the [`pscl` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pscl/index.html).
