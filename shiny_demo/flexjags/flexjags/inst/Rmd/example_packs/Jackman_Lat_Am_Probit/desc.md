Jackman (example 2.9, p. 72) presents an analysis of data from 20-year periods in Latin America. If a country was invaded or lost territory in a 20 year span, does that lead to revolution? We focus for now on 20-year spans in which a country was invaded or lost territory. There were 8, according to Sekhon (2005), and a revolution happened in 1 of those periods. In 76 20-year periods where no loss/defeat occured, revolution occured in 2.

Ill-advisedly, we follow Jackman and model these data with a binomial setting. In this example, a probit model is used.
