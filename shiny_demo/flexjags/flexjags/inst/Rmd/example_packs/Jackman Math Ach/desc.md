Jackman (2009) offers the following Example 7.6 (page 323).

> ANOVA. The 1982 High School and Beyond Survey is a nationally representative sample of US public and Catholic schools, covering 7185 students in 160 schools. The chief outcome of interest is a standardized measure of math ability, with a mean of 12.75 and IQR of [7.28, 18.32]. These data figure prominently in the standard reference on hierarchical linear models (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002), and so are well suited for our purposes here. We fit a one-way ANOVA model (Equation 7.1 in Example 7.1), recognizing that students are grouped by school. We momentarily ignore school type (public vs Catholic) and other school-level characteristicsâ€¦
